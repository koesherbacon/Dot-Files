# Dot-Files
These are the .[files] I use with my current Chapeau 23 distribution

I primarily use [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) instead of regular bash.  I also use [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) (aka [ohmyz.sh](http://ohmyz.sh/)) and **strongly** recomend you do as well.  

My personal favorite theme for oh-my-zsh is called ["dpoggi"](http://bit.ly/1n6rEL3) which I believe comes standard with oh-my-zsh, but just in case go ahead and click the link and you can download it for free!  I find that if there's too much information displayed it can be overwhelming so I tend to follow the [KISS Principal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), thus I prefer "dpoggi" because it's simple, to the point, and generally looks very nice no matter what I'm going with my terminal.

I am positive that the aliases I have created for my personal `~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/` would work perfectly find for bash and probably even [fish](https://fishshell.com/). [xyzsh](https://github.com/ab25cq/xyzsh), [fizsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/fizsh), or any other shell you might prefer.  

Please feel free to use, fork, edit anything within this repo.

It's my first one, so I gladly welcome input, questions, commends and constructive-criticism.  I would also appreciate some GitHub stars so I can see if this is helping others.

Thanks a lot!
